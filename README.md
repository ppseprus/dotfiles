# dotfiles

This is a repository to store my dotfiles.

I use both a Mac and a PC, therefore, I'm trying to create a good and consistent environment that I can easily set/install on any device.

### Visuals

I use Sublime Text with @equinusocio's [Material](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme) theme, so the background of the terminal is matched to that.

The bash Prompt Statement and my Git commands use the following colors.
Though, on Windows the red is different. For some reason, mingw64 prints it differently.

HEX Code | xterm-256color
--- | ---
#263138 | terminal bg
#AF0000 | `124` on Mac
#FF0000 | `009` on Win
#00AFD7 | `038`
#00D7AF | `043`
#FFFF5F | `227`

### Credit

A huge amount of code is actually taken from @mathiasbynens' [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) repository, but @janmoesen's [tilde](https://github.com/janmoesen/tilde) was also a great inspiration.
